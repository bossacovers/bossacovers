            <h2>What is Bossa&nbsp;Nova?</h2>
            <p>Bossa nova, which literally means “new trend” or “new wave” in Portuguese, emerged in the late 1950s in Rio de Janeiro.  
            The term was used in artistic circles to describe any fashionable wave or innovation.  
            Brazilian journalists and musicians popularised the expression at a concert in 1957 featuring Sylvia Telles and other young artists.</p>

            <h2>Origins and Early History</h2>
            <p>The style developed as a modern take on samba‑canção during the 1950s.  
            Singer Elizeth Cardoso’s 1958 album <em>Canção do Amor Demais</em> included the songs “Outra Vez” and “Chega de Saudade,” composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinícius de Moraes and accompanied by João Gilberto’s innovative guitar beat.  
            Gilberto’s 1959 album <em>Chega de Saudade</em> is considered the landmark of bossa nova; his subtle guitar rhythms and understated vocals, combined with Jobim’s harmonies and de Moraes’s lyrics, defined the sound.</p>

            <h2>Instrumentation and Rhythm</h2>
            <p>Bossa nova is most commonly performed on a nylon‑string classical guitar, played with the fingers rather than with a pick.  
            Gilberto adapted the rhythmic layers of samba to the guitar, creating a picking pattern that alternates bass notes with syncopated chords.  
            A simple bossa nova rhythm on guitar emphasises the second beat and features gentle syncopation without the swing feel typical of jazz.  
            Percussion instruments such as the surdo, clave and cabasa provide a soft, steady accompaniment.</p>

            <h2>Lyrics and Themes</h2>
            <p>The lyrics of bossa nova often focus on love, longing, homesickness and nature.  
            Unlike samba’s lively dance rhythms, bossa nova was frequently apolitical and reflective, portraying the easy‑going lifestyle of Rio’s middle and upper classes.  
            Its relaxed mood and sophisticated harmonies made it suitable for listening rather than dancing.</p>

            <h2>International Impact</h2>
            <p>Bossa nova gained international recognition when João Gilberto and Stan Getz released the album <em>Getz/Gilberto</em> in 1964, introducing global audiences to hits like “The Girl from Ipanema.”  
            The genre’s gentle sway influenced many jazz musicians and later pop artists, and elements of bossa nova can still be heard in contemporary music.  
            Its fusion of samba rhythms and cool jazz harmonies continues to inspire musicians worldwide.</p>
